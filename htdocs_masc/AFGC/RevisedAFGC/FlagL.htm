<h2><FONT SIZE=5><P ALIGN="CENTER"><br>Guide to the Flagging of AFGC Experiments in SMD</h2>

</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=3><font color=red><P ALIGN="CENTER">Updated by Lorne Rose on August 1, 2002.</P></font>

<P Align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flagging is the process  marking of spots on the array that are deemed bad. Spots flagged as bad are given a flag value of &quot;-100&quot;, saturated spots are given a flag value of
&quot;-50&quot; (if experiment is loaded after 12-18-00), and unflagged (acceptable) spots are given a flag value of &quot;0&quot; in SMD. This is a manual step performed by the AFGC staff at the data extraction step. Spots are flagged for on a variety of reasons as listed below:</P>


<UL>
<LI>If the median intensity in one or both channels is over 65,535 (an indication that the measurement is saturated), then the spot is flagged. If you encounter flagged spots that look good but that are high in intensity, then the spot was most likely saturated. Ratio values for spots in which the intensity value of at least one of the channels was saturated will be misleading. In some cases, transcript levels will be high and give rise to saturating intensities in one channel and transcript levels will be low in the second channel. Such a spot/gene will be flagged as saturated, but may still of interest to the researcher. If the experiment was loaded after 12-18-00 then saturated spots will be flagged with a value of &quot;-50&quot;, if the experiment was loaded before 12-18-00 then the saturated spots will have a flag value of &quot;-100&quot;.</LI></UL>



<UL>
<LI>Dust is another major reason for flagging spots. Within some of spots, specks that vary from saturated to faint in appearance may occur. If the specks are in both channels, then this is most likely due to dust in the spot. If the specks are in only one channel then this is likely due to some other type of noise that will interfere with the accuracy of the intensity reading. If either of these types of specks occurs in a spot, then the spot is flagged as bad.</LI></UL>



<UL>
<LI>A donut is any spot in which the hybridization occurs in a ring
    formation (see:<U><COLOR="#0000ff"><A HREF="FlagSpots.ppt"> Examples of flagged spots</A></U>). Donuts thus far have been flagged based on the presence of saturated pixels in the outside rim of the spot. With most of the signal occurring on the outside rim of the spot, a donut spot have a hollow middle, which lowers the intensity readings relative to what they would have been had the spot been uniformly hybridized. </LI></UL>
<ul>
<li>Spots that have a heterogeneous distribution of DNA are flagged with the bad flag. These spots can be recognized by an uneven color scheme, where there appears to be two overlapping spots. The problem with these spots is that it is hard to differentiate which is the true expression pattern.</li></ul>

<UL>
<LI>Finally, spots that have streaks, heavy background, or any other type of phenomenon that may lead to a miscalculation of the intensity reading are flagged bad. Streaks vary a lot in their type. Some are very distinguishable, and some are just dark enough to give a possible false reading. </LI></UL>



<UL>
<LI><i>Golden rule of flagging</i>: If something in the spot looks wrong, then it is wrong, and should be flagged. </LI></UL>


<P Align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please click on the following link </FONT><A HREF="FlagSpots.ppt">examples of flagged spots</A> to see some examples of the spots that were
talked about above. You will notice that it is hard to tell at times why a
spot was flagged when viewing the reconstructed gif images in SMD. Using
the Genepix 3.0 software program
<U><COLOR="#0000ff"> <A HREF="http://www.axon.com/GN_GenePixSoftware.html">(http://www.axon.com/GN_GenePixSoftware.html)</A></U>, we
are able to view both channels quite clearly, as well as the overlaid
image of the microarray. Spots are flagged based on the Genepix image and
not from the SMD image. The <U><COLOR="#0000ff"><A HREF="FlagSpots.ppt">Examples of flagged spots</A></U> page displays both the Genepix and SMD images for problematic spots, illustrating the differences between the two types of images.</P>

<B><P Align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A word to the wise</B>: In SMD, if you set the flag filter to &quot;0&quot; (note: this is often the default value), then you will not retrieve data for flagged spots. If you would like to include flagged spots in your analyses, then set the flag filter value to &quot;less than or equal to 0&quot;. If you wish to view only the flagged spots, then set the filter flag value to &quot;less than 0&quot;. If you would like to include good and saturated spots only in your analysis then set the flag filter to &quot;greater than or equal to &#150;50&quot;. The spots that are flagged will have a hash mark crossed through them in the ARRAY IMAGE + GRID and in the CLICKABLE IMAGE view. In addition, when you click on an individual spot on an image in SMD, a new web page (SPOT DATA page) will appear containing all the information on that spot, including the spot flag value. </P>

<P Align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A general recommendation when analyzing the data is that you look at any of the spots that you may be interested in carefully and judge for yourself if that is a spot that you want to use.</P>

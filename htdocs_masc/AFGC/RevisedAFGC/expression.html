  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this page, we are presenting a new tool which gives an easy access to the expression data from several hundred microarray slides in Arabidopsis Functional Genomics Consortium (AFGC) public microarray experiments. This tool was created to provide the user with a visual display of gene expression for selected genes in selected biologically/functionally related experiments. Along with that, it gives the expression profile of up to 19 correlated genes to the gene under query. So, in one step it is possible to view the expression data for a cluster of genes across various experiments. This substantially reduces the search time for an individual user and gives ample information about a gene.
  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, the list of experiments in AFGC database is functionally categorized into 7 different datasets based on the goal/behavior of each experiment and they are listed below. This helps decrease the execution time for each query. Next all possible "distances" between genes on the  AFGC microarrays were calculated within each category and this  measure (i.e., Pearson Correlation Coefficient) was used to identify  groups of genes
with similar expression profiles within each category. If you would like to learn more about the experiments that are included here, you can find the abstracts for some of the experiments at <a href="../RevisedAFGC/site2Cycle1L.htm">AFGC Accepted Experiments</a> on AFGC web page.
<p>Datasets:</p>
<ul>
  <p><li>Abiotic:</p>
  <p><li>Biotic:</p>
  <p><li>Hormone:</p>
  <p><li>Metabolism:</p>
      <p><li>Anatomical comparison:</p>
	  <p><li>Development:</p>
	      <p><li>Test:</p>
</ul>
 
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To utilize the Expression Viewer, the user
selects a gene of interest using a cloneid on the <a
href="QueryEST.html">CloneList page</a> on the AFGC microarray page. Once
the query is submitted, in the CloneList result page, you find this logo
<img src="../images/clusterLogo1.jpg" align=middle> .  Click on the logo in
the result page and follow the directions to view the Expression Viewer.
In Expression Viewer, the user selects an experiment category (e.g., abiotic stress) for which s/he would like to view the expression profile of the selected gene. The Expression Viewer will return the expression profile for the selected experiment category of the selected gene and up to 19 genes with similar expression profiles.

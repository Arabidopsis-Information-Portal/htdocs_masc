      <li>If we need to send 5 micrograms poly-A+ RNA per treatment, and the
	  experiments are duplicated, does this mean we are really sending 10
	  micrograms per treatment? </li></font>
	  
	  <ul>Yes. We would like to have 5 micrograms of mRNA for each
	    label.</ul></p>
	    <hr>
<p><font color=336633><li>I'm working with tissues that are hard to isolate RNA from. Can I send less than 5 micrograms poly-A+?</li></font>
		<ul>It's okay to send 2.5 micrograms or more of poly-A+
		RNA. Much less than that and we may run into problems. In
		particular, if we maybe unable to re-do a sample or run a quality control. </ul></p>
<hr>		
<p><font color=336633><li>  I isolated poly-A+ RNA, ran a gel and saw extra bands that looked like ribosomal RNA. Is it normal to still have rRNA in your mRNA sample? Does that affect the microarray experiment? </li></font>
    <ul>  You may see some ribosomal RNA "mixed in" with you mRNA. It's
      almost impossible to completely rid your sample of all ribosomal
      RNA, but you can clean your RNA until the vast majority of it is
      gone. Poly-A+ RNA isolation kits (like the Qiagen kit) are actually
      pretty good for that type of clean-up (no less than 90% of what's
      recovered is poly-A+ RNA). The residual amount of rRNA left in your sample won't interfere with your reverse transcription. If your
      reverse transcription is good, you should get good labeling and a
      nice microarray. </ul></p>
<hr>
      
<p><font color=336633><li>What method do you use to determine mRNA yield? Aren't the amounts recovered too small to spec?</li></font>
    <ul>We quantitate mRNA in 50 microliters microcell. The detection
      could be as low as 0.2mg. We have also used Ribo-green to detect
      very small amounts of RNA. </ul></p>
<hr>      
<p><font color=336633><li>Have you ever isolated RNA from root (or other specific) tissue? If so, what was your yield? What protocol did you use? </li></font>
    <ul>The approximate yield from tissues is listed in the 'Yield of
    Total RNA from various tissue types' table under the Protocol page of the Microarray Tab. Please refer to the Pine Tree Method for isolation procedure.</ul></p>
<hr>
<p><font color=336633><li>If we can't amplify your positive control sample, can we use our own positive control? </li></font>	
    <ul>Yes, as long as you give us sufficient information about the positive control you are using (i.e., the type and quantity of the standard).</ul></p>
<hr>
<p><font color=336633><li>What is the purpose of the Reverse Transcriptase
    protocol included in the instructions? I thought we were going to send mRNA? </li></font>
    <ul>We need to see, as a quality control, that your mRNA is capable of being reverse-transcribed.</ul></p> 
<hr>
<p><font color=336633><li>On your website you have an RNase-inhibitor from Bio 101 listed, but the company says they don't sell this item. Do you know anything about this? </li></font>
    <ul>The "inhibitor" the site refers to is actually "Ase-Erase" from Bio 101. It's not an actual inhibitor but rather a matrix that binds proteins, thus keeping your sample DNase/RNase-free. It is OK to use other sources of RNA inhibitors or not include any.</ul></p>
<hr>
<p><font color=336633><li>After the RT with dCTP, how is the gel dried on aluminum foil-- in a fume hood or on a gel drier? </li></font>
    <ul>You can dry your gel down on a gel drier without aluminum foil. A collaborator of ours dried her radioactive gel down in a general lab oven and so used aluminum foil to line the rack. </ul></p>
<hr>
<p><font color=336633><li>Instead of using radiotracer, can we use DIG? What protocol do you suggest for that? </li></font>
    <ul>You can surely use DIG for labeling purposes. According to the kit
    booklet, you can label anywhere from 1 nanogram to 3 micrograms of DNA. We sent you 100-ng cDNA, so you should be able to use that. </ul></p>
<hr>
<p><font color=336633><li>Can we send our RNA samples under Ethanol?</li></font> 
    <ul>Yes. Just let us know the percent and the amount of Ethanol covering your sample. We suggest using 70%-80% Ethanol. </ul></p>
<hr>						    
<p><font color=336633><li>Can we send our RNA samples as pellets?</li></font> 
    <ul>No. It's best to send RNA dissolved in RNase-free water or under Ethanol. RNA should not be dried down into a pellet, as it is extremely difficult to resuspend it.</ul></p>
<hr>
<p><font color=336633><li>Can we change our experiment from the originally accepted proposal? </li></font>
    <ul>No. Remember, your proposal was chosen specifically by the AFGC Priorities Committee. If you need to change your proposal significantly, it would be better to apply for the next cycle.</ul></p>
<hr>
<p><font color=336633><li>Is the service worldwide, or only available in the United States?</li></font> 
    <ul>The service is indeed worldwide. Thus far we've had customers from Europe and Southeast Asia as well as customers from Canada and the U.S.</ul></p>
<hr>
<p><font color=336633><li>On the website the only address listed is the MSU address. Could you list both sites' addresses for all the customers to see?</li></font>
    <ul>Both sites should be listed on the updated version of the web site. FYI, Carnegie's contact information is as follows: </ul>
    <ul>
      AFGC Microarray Facility<br> 
      Carnegie Institution of Washington, <br>
      Department of Plant Biology, <br>
      260 Panama St.,<br>
      Stanford, CA 94305</ul>
      
      </p>
<hr>
<p><font color=336633><li>
    When will be the latest time I can submit my samples? <br>
    1. Our experiments aren't done yet<br>
    2. Someone left the lab and we're short-handed<br>
    3. We just moved and need time to set up<br>
    4. We just moved and lost half of our seed/tissue/plant material<br>
    5. We can't produce enough RNA in the time allotted<br>
    6. "Unexpected problems"<br></li></font>
    <ul>For Cycle-2, the sample submission deadline is September 1st.
      Priority will be given to those who submitted samples by the
      original submission date. If you find that your samples will not be
      in by the September 1st deadline, we will still except them, but
      they will receive priority behind Cycle-2 AND early Cycle-3
      submissions (if any arrive in the meantime).</ul></p></b>

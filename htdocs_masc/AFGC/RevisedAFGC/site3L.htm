<center><h3><br>AFGC GENE KNOCKOUT SERVICES</h3></center><br>
<center><h3><font color =red>Updated August 1, 2002</font></h3></center><br>
<p align="justify"><basefont size=3>The <a href="http://www.biotech.wisc.edu/Arabidopsis/">Gene Knockout
Service Facility</a> of the AFGC is located in the Biotechnology Center of
the Universtiy of Wisconsin, Madison. Mike Sussman, Director of the Biotechnology Center, established the Knockout Center together with Rick Amasino, who generated the plant lines. The coordinator of the Knockout Facility is Sandra Austin-Philips.
</p>
<p align="justify">The Gene Knockout Technology Development of the AFGC is
  located at Yale University. Steve Dellaporta is developing new
  technologies to expedite gene
knockout screening by the AFGC. Additional knockout lines are also being
generated at Yale. </p>

<center><h3>The End Game for Reverse Genetics in Arabidopsis: Isolation of a Knockout for Every Gene</h3></center>

<p align ="justify">The Arabidopsis Knockout project that began as part
of the multi-institutional AFGC with PI's Sussman, Amasino, Dellaporta,
Green, Keegstra, Orhrogge, Cherry and Somerville is no longer being
funded. A new NSF-2010 project entitled "The End Game for Reverse Genetics in Arabidopsis:
Isolation of a Knockout for Every Gene" was recently awarded to Mike
Sussman and Rick Amasino (University of Wisconsin) and is focused on
exploring new technologies to allow the production of a knockout plant for
every gene in an crop species. This grant has been described in the
journal,<i> Plant Physiology</i> (Ausubel, F.M. 2002. Summaries of
National Science Foundation-sponsored Arabidopsis 2010 Projects and
National Science Foundation-sponsored Plant Genome Projects that are
generating Arabidopsis resources for the community. Plant Physiol.
129:394-437) and  is mainly focused on the use of a benchtop machine
called a maskless array synthesizer (MAS) developed at the University of
Wisconsin, which uses photolithographic techniques to create high density
oligonucleotide arrays (Singh-Gasson, S. et al. 1999. Maskless fabrication of light-directed oligonucleotide microarrays using a digital micromirror array. Nature Biotech. 17:974-978).  

<p align="justify">The basic problem with creating a knockout for every
gene, using T-DNA as an insertional mutagen is that, because the procedure is essentially
random, small genes have a very low likelihood of getting hit. Thus, one
must generate a forbiddingly too high number of independent insertional
lines, to obtain knockouts in these genes. For ca. 60-75% of the genome,
the individual T-DNA lines for which TAIL sequence from the flanking DNA
has been obtained should suffice in generating an excellent knockout
resource. (Salk Institute Genomic Analysis Laboratory produced a <a href="http://signal.salk.edu/cgi-bin/tdnaexpress">Sequence-Indexed Library of Insertion Mutations in the Arabidopsis Genome</a>). However, for researchers working with small genes, or the significant percentage of genes that exist as tandem duplications, this resource will not provide the tools needed to determine gene function. To obtain knockout plants for small genes, one may still wish to screen the 130,000 lines in the UW Biotechnology Center Arabidopsis Knockout Facility. In addition, using the MAS, Sussman and Amasino are exploring new ways of obtaining knockout plants, even for crop species in which high throughput T-DNA insertional mutagenesis is not a viable option. The results from these studies will be reported on the Wisconsin website, as well as via normal publication and reports at scientific meetings. 
<p align="justify">During the course of these experiments, <a href ="http://www.biotech.wisc.edu/Arabidopsis/">the Arabidopsis Knockout Facility at the UW Biotechnology Center</a> continues to perform PCR-based screening service to identify knockouts. Users are advised to check the database of T-DNA insertions mapped by the SALK Institute before using the UW resource.

A set of clones was selected for sequencing from ~11,500 EST clones used to generate DNAs for the AFGC Y2000 microarrays. The set included ~800 EST clones selected by Shu Wu on the basis of their responsiveness to various light treatments; ~250 EST clones selected by Rob Ewing as singleton EST clones; and ~300 EST clones selected by Jeremy Gollub on the basis of their expression patterns in 162 slides. The latter group of EST clones included 100 representing weakly expressed genes, 100 representing genes with highly variable ratio values, and 100 representing genes with very stable ratio values. There was some redundancy in the three lists of EST clones. The final number of clones sequenced was 1,343.
 
Plasmid DNA from the "template plates" for the 1,343 EST clones was
reassembled in 96-well plates. The inserts were PCR amplified and then
cleaned using Multiscreen PCR filter plates. These products were
fluorescently labeled using ABI PRISM&#174; BigDye. Terminators, v2.0. Cycle sequencing products were purified using Millipore MultiScreen&#174; Filter Plates. Sequencing was performed on an ABI PRISM 3700 DNA ANALYZER. Clones giving sequences that did not match to the clone designation in GenBank were re-picked from the original "template DNA" plates and re-sequenced. The results of these sequencing reactions are summarized below in Table 1 and Table 2.

(1) Excludes clones for which no reliable sequence was obtained.
 
<P>The proportion of mis-labeled clones is low. However, by extrapolation,
we would expect ~114 mis-labeled clones among the 11,500 elements on the Y2000 AFGC arrays.

<li>(1) The TIGR Chromosome Locus and Gene Descriptions were obtained from the AFGC Clone Query Page (http://afgc.stanford.edu/afgc_html/QueryEST.html) on November 1, 2001.<br> 
<li>(2) The sequence obtained matched sequence BE039105, which was derived from clone AB09F11 from the Bohnert group. However, no clones from the Bohnert group were used in the construction of the AFGC array. Thus, we cannot match the sequence to a unique clone on the Y2000 array. <br>
<li>(3) The sequence we generated for the clone identified as 175A20T7 was clone 199C12RTM (1.0 x e-142). However, since the full sequence of clone 199C12RTM is unknown and since there are numerous EST clones for the small subunit of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase, we cannot unequivocally state that the true identity of the DNA we used was 199C12RTM.
<br>
<p>In subsequent sequencing, three clones (E1C12T7, E7E6T7 and E3E9T7) were identified as chimeric. All three of these clones were derived from the CD4-13 library and it is possible that clones from this library have a higher probability of being chimeric. <br>

<P>Based on the occurrence of chimeric and mis-labeled clones among the clones used to produce the Y2000 array, it is important that significant results be verified by an independent test. <br>
